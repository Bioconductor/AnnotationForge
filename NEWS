NEW FEATURES

    o adds more general mechanism for creating organism packages.
    makeOrgPackage() will now allow users to pass in a series of
    data.frames, and (provided that they are formatted correctly) will
    compile those into a gene-centric organism package.  The aim is to
    provide a more general mechanism for people who are working on
    organisms that are off the beaten path.

    o updates to the documentation (new vignettes) to better clarify
    how users who need to make new organism packages should do so.

		AnnotationForge VERSION 1.0.0


PKG FEATURES

    o	All of the code that used to live in AnnotationDbi but was
        primarily involved in the creation of new annotation packages
        now lives here.

NEW FEATURES

    o New biocViews tags have been added to the code that generates all
    the new Annotation packages.  These allow users to search
    annotation packages by the type of annotation package that they
    are.  So for example you can now quickly list only the
    TranscriptDb packages by using the web site.
