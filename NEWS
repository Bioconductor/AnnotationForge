		AnnotationForge VERSION 1.0.0


PKG FEATURES

    o	All of the code that used to live in AnnotationDbi but was
        primarily involved in the creation of new annotation packages
        now lives here.

NEW FEATURES

    o New biocViews tags have been added to the code that generates all
    the new Annotation packages.  These allow users to search
    annotation packages by the type of annotation package that they
    are.  So for example you can now quickly list only the
    TranscriptDb packages by using the web site.
