Some todos:

 1) links, toTable etc need to be better documented

 2) hgu95av2_dbschema() should not just cat its output across 
 the screen - it should return something that could be processed

 3) Put details on the meta data needed for building chip packages
  into the vignette
  myMeta = c("DBSCHEMA" = "HUMANCHIP_DB",
           "ORGANISM" = "Homo sapiens",
           "SPECIES" = "Human",
           "MANUFACTURER" = "Affymetrix",
           "CHIPNAME" = "Affymetrix Human Genome U95 Set Version 2",
           "MANUFACTURERURL" = "http:www.affymetrix.com")

  4) Add a function to the templates for all the classes to make the
  datacache available do this before we push out new devel packages in
  January. So near to where you see: 
  @ANNOBJPREFIX@_dbInfo <- function() dbInfo(datacache) 
  Add something that will produce:
  hgu95av2_datacache(), once it has been called.
