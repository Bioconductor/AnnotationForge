\description{
  
  Welcome to the @ANNOBJPREFIX@.db annotation Package.  The purpose of
  this package is to provide detailed information about the
  @ANNOBJPREFIX@ platform. Bioconductor attempts to update this package
  biannually with the most recently available inparanoid data, but
  inparanoid data sources have not historically updated that frequently.
  Please check inparanoid to learn more about when they have last
  updated their databases.
  
  You can learn what objects this package supports with the following command:

  \code{ls("package:@ANNOBJPREFIX@.db")} 
  
  Each of these objects has their own manual page detailing where
  relevant data was obtained along with some examples of how to use it.
