\title{Map between TAIR IDs and Genes}
\description{
  @ANNOBJPREFIX@GENENAME is an R object that maps TAIR
  identifiers to the corresponding gene name.
}

\details{
  Each TAIR identifier maps to a named vector containing the gene
  name. The vector name corresponds to the TAIR identifier. If
  the gene name is unknown, the vector will contain an \code{NA}.
  
  Gene names currently include both the official (validated by a
  nomenclature committee) and preferred names (interim selected for
  display) for genes. Efforts are being made to differentiate the two
  by adding a name to the vector.

  Mappings were based on data provided by: @GENENAMESOURCE@

## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
x <- @ANNOBJPREFIX@GENENAME
# Get the TAIR identifiers that are mapped to a gene name
mapped_tairs <- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x[mapped_tairs])
if(length(xx) > 0) {
  # Get the GENENAME for the first five tairs
  xx[1:5]
  # Get the first one
  xx[[1]]
}
