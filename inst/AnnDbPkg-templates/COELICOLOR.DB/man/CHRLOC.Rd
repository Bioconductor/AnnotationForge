\title{Entrez Gene IDs to Chromosomal Location}
\description{
  @ANNOBJPREFIX@CHRLOC is an R object that maps entrez gene identifiers to the
  starting position of the gene. The position of a gene is
  measured as the number of base pairs.

  The CHRLOCEND mapping is the same as the CHRLOC mapping except that it
  specifies the ending base of a gene instead of the start.
}
\details{
  Each entrez gene identifier maps to a named vector of chromosomal locations,
  where the name indicates the chromosome. 
  
  Chromosomal locations on both the sense and antisense strands are
  measured as the number of base pairs from the p (5' end of the sense
  strand) to q (3' end of the sense strand) arms. Chromosomal locations on the
  antisense strand have a leading "-" sign (e. g. -1234567). 

  Since some genes have multiple start sites, this field can map to
  multiple locations.
 
  Mappings were based on data provided by: @CHRLOCSOURCE@

## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
x <- @ANNOBJPREFIX@CHRLOC
# Get the entrez gene identifiers that are mapped to chromosome locations
mapped_genes <- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x[mapped_genes])
if(length(xx) > 0) {
  # Get the CHRLOC for the first five genes
  xx[1:5]
  # Get the first one
  xx[[1]]
}
