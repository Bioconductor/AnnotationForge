\title{Map between Manufacturer Identifiers and cytogenetic maps/bands}
\description{
   @ANNOBJPREFIX@MAP is an R object that provides mappings between
   manufacturer identifiers and cytoband locations.
}
\details{
  Each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a vector of cytoband locations. The
  vector length may be one or longer, if there are multiple reported
  chromosomal locations for a given gene. An \code{NA} is reported for
  any manufacturer identifiers that cannot be mapped to a cytoband at this time.
  
  Cytogenetic bands for most higher organisms are labeled p1, p2, p3,
  q1, q2, q3 (p and q are the p and q arms), etc., counting from the
  centromere out toward the telomeres. At higher resolutions, sub-bands
  can be seen within the bands. The sub-bands are also numbered from the
  centromere out toward the telomere. Thus, a label of 7q31.2 indicates
  that the band is on chromosome 7, q arm, band 3, sub-band 1, and
  sub-sub-band 2.
  
  Mappings were based on data provided by: @MAPSOURCE@

## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
x <- @ANNOBJPREFIX@MAP
# Get the probe identifiers that are mapped to any cytoband
mapped_probes <- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x[mapped_probes])
if(length(xx) > 0) {
  # Get the MAP for the first five probes
  xx[1:5]
  # Get the first one
  xx[[1]]
}
