		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.9.5


NEW FEATURES

    o An organism package has been added for Streptomyces coelicolor

    o extensive overhaul of inparanoid packages means that inparanoid
    packages now match to 100 different organisms

    o Extended support for ensembl mappings to yeast and flies.

NOTEWORTHY CHANGES BETWEEN THIS version and 1.3.11

    o All chip packages now depend on org packages.  This simplifies
    the schema and also allows for more convenient updating of these
    packages and smaller downloads for users.

    o chip package mappings that contain probes which map to multiple
    targets are now hidden by default, with the ability to be exposed
    when required.  See the use of the new toggleProbes() method.

		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.3.11


NEW FEATURES

    o Support has been added for 3 more organisms, this means that the
    current list of supported organisms as of 1.3.11 is the following:
    	    Arabidopsis thaliana
    	    Bos taurus
	    Caenorhabditis elegans
	    Canis familiaris
	    Drosophila melanogaster
	    Danio rerio
	    Escherichia coli K12 Strain
	    Escherichia coli Sakai Strain
	    Gallus gallus
	    Homo sapiens
	    Mus musculus
	    Plasmodium falciparum
	    Rattus norvegicus
	    Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	    Sus scrofa

    o Added support for GO to canine and pig packages by using
    BLAST2GO (this data was not available from NCBI for these
    organisms).

    o ZFIN IDs are supported for Zebrafish packages.

    o Wormbase IDs are supported for C. elegans packages.

    o Uniprot IDs have been added to almost all package types.

    o CHRLOCEND mapping has been added which give gene end positions
    for almost all packages and compliments the CHRLOC mapping which
    already provides the start positions.

		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.1.7


NEW FEATURES

    o	Annotation packages now have a function to display basic 
    	quality control information.

    o	5 Inparanoid packages have been added for use in studies 
    	involving homology.

    o	Ensembl gene ID maps have been added to all mammalian 
    	packages.

    o	MGI IDs maps have been added for all Mouse packages.

    o	Protein to gene mappings have been added to appropriate 
    	organism based packages so that it will be possible to get 
	from the IDs in the inparanoid packages to a gene based ID 
	for the 5 main organism types (ie. Human, Mouse, Rat, Fly, 
	Yeast).

    o	Support has been added for PFAM so that there can now be a 
    	PFAM.db package.

    o	AnnotationDbi is now compliant with the 1.0 schema definition.
